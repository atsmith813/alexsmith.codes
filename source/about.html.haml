        Our DNA is 96% chimpanzee. Is that even worth arguing?! If I gave
        you a sandwich that was filled with 96% sh*t and 4% ham, would you
        be willing to consider that a ham sandwich? So If you ever start
        taking things too seriously, just remember that we are talking monkeys
        on an organic spaceship flying through the universe. - Joe Rogan
