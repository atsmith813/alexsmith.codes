          TLDR
        %p
          A borderline cold brew coffee addict and a Florida native currently
          residing in Los Angeles, California, my name is Alexander Smith (Alex).
          If I had to describe a
          %em "personal mission statement"
          , I'd say that mine is to provide others with opportunities -
          especially if it helps them move up the so-called socio-economic
          ladder.
        %p
          While I call Tampa home, I was born in Baltimore, MD and I've
          been to Germany more times than my fingers permit me to count. I have a
          black belt in Taekwondo (it's been awhile though). I originally planned
          to join the military and was in ROTC in High School. My friends call me
          an adrenaline junkie because I love anything with an engine. I've had
          experience with 4-wheelers, go-karts, boats, jet skis, motorcycles,
          sports cars, and more. If it goes fast, I'm interested. Speaking of
          interested, want to learn more?  You can read more about...

          Our DNA is 96% chimpanzee. Is that even worth arguing?! If I gave
          you a sandwich that was filled with 96% sh*t and 4% ham, would you
          be willing to consider that a ham sandwich? So If you ever start
          taking things too seriously, just remember that we are talking monkeys
          on an organic spaceship flying through the universe. - Joe Rogan

          Hobbies and interests can be so vague...I like to think of this section
          as answers to the question of, "what are some things that you would go
          out of your way to do in your free time?". But that's not a cool title
          so I still call these hobbies and interests.
