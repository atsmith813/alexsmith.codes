# [alexsmith.codes](https://alexsmith.codes "My personal website")
Here is my personal site, alexsmith.codes! It serves 2 main purposes.
1. Tell people more about me.
2. With a name as generic as Alex Smith, I wanted something I could point
  everything back to (blog posts, forum posts, etc.) to help keep my personal
  branding more consistent.
